#| fig-alt: "This scatterplot aims to account for the confounding variable that skews the relationship between SAT Scores and Expenditure and Teacher Salary. This is done by recreating the trivariate plot in Trivariate Best Work. Then we execute a facet and split the data into groups by participation, specifically by the proportion of students who actually take the SATs per state."
