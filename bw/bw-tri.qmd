#| fig-alt: "This scatterplot showcases the relationship between education, expenditure of educational resources and teachers salary.In the later parts of the in class activity, we see that there is a confounding variable that is skewing the relationship between SAT scores and salaries/expenditure. Once we account for the proportion of students who actually take the SATs per state, the trend we observe becomes less unusual."
